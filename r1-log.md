### Day 17

As per my last blog post, I'm switching to this as my logging tool. Just to save time. Today I had a look at object oriented programming in Fortran. I should say this is heavy for me. But, the good thing is, if I learnt it properly I may actually use object oriented programming for once!

### Day 18

Today I didn't do any Fortran coding. But, solved few questions in Hacker rank using python. Will continue with Fortran tommorrow.

### Day 19

Today I covered more about abstract classes and overloading `write` function for user defined data types. Have started with the exercises and wrote some Object Oriented code. Also, read about concept of Composition over inheritance!

### Day 20

I didn't work for 2 days. Will try to keep this more steady. Here is Sierpi≈Ñski triangle that I plotted today! Next step - implement box counting for the same!

### Day 21

Today I learnt about error handling and best practices in Fortran. And, also made some progress in implementing box counting (for finding hausdorff dimension). It does take time!

### Day 22

Today, I spent most of the time trying to figure out a way to implement box counting. Uh, it's been hard. But, finally, I've found a way. Will implement (for real this time) tommorrow!
